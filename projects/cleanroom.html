    While I have more in depth experience with using the cleanroom from the
    research I performed during my undergraduate studies, I wanted to highlight
    the overall cleanroom skills I acquired from another lab class that I took
    in IC development. This class accompanied a lecture class on semiconductor
    devices. The two went hand in hand in teaching us how to make the best
    devices within the cleanroom and why such an environment is needed for
    their fabrication.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    We used a variety of machines to deposit both metals and oxides, spin resist
    and create photo-lithographic masks, and etch and layer those mask patterns
    on our wafers to create specific designs and devices. We learned how to
    monitor the processes so that we didn't need to start over on any steps and
    create some good devices with proper feature specifications. Other skills we
    learned include cleaning and cleaving the wafers, as well as measuring their
    properties, such as voltage across MOSFET devices and oxide thickness. Of
    course, we also learned proper procedures to follow in first-aid and
    emergency situations.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Among the final deliverables for the course, we made wafers full of
    functioning MOSFETS, as well as a tricolor dielectric image using various
    masks for red, green, and blue layers (colors dependent on oxide thickness).
    I learned a great deal about what kinds of devices are enable by a cleanroom
    as well as the limits to current technologies. The lecture portion of the
    class covered a variety of theories on how cleanroom technologies could be
    enhanced to enable even smaller feature sizes.
