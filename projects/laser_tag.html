    During my junior year at BYU, we had a design project that combined the
    skills we had learned in the core classes we had taken throughout the year,
    such as advanced circuit design, signal processing, and embedded systems
    programming, to create a laser tag system. We began by designing and
    building the transmitter and receiver boards for the system in our circuits
    class. We learned to balance the trade-offs between gain amplification and
    noise reduction to reach the proper signal level that would be reliable and
    work across a great enough distance to make the game more enjoyable. We also
    learned all about filtering signals largely using Fourier transforms. By so
    doing, we were able to create ten distinct player frequencies that could be
    detected separately by our system, all while filtering out the extra noise
    from the other lights in the room, as well as from aliasing. Finally, we
    implemented this filtering code to work on our microprocessors, as well as
    added a variety of state machines to provide proper game functionality and
    user interfaces to make the game run smoothly and be as enjoyable as
    possible. My team was able to overcome the challenges it faced and deliver
    some reliable systems. The best part was getting to actually play with our
    systems and know how they worked and exactly why certain issues might be
    occurring. This project was also a great exercise in working together as a
    team to accomplish our various tasks, communicate with each other, and
    report on the work we had accomplished.

    I also had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for this project the
    following year. This allowed me to even further deepen my understanding of
    the concepts and code structure of the filtering systems and state machines
    used to implement these systems. It also gave me a better understanding of
    how to work with the microprocessor's SDK, from setting it up properly to
    troubleshooting issues that occurred throughout the class. Also, a change to
    the class required each team to come up with an extra feature for the game,
    and I got to help the students bring their concepts to fruition and actually
    implement them into the game. We saw everything from bluetooth-enabled score
    trackers and new game modes to power-up stations and souped-up shotguns with
    super bright lights to give them the advantage. That's what I like to call
    <strike>cheating</strike> creativity and thinking outside of the box.
