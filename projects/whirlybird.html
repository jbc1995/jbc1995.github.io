    As a senior tech elective class at BYU, I took a course on Control Systems.
    Our lectures taught us how to design and optimize various control systems,
    and we got to apply that knowledge in a lab. In the lab, we worked on
    implementing these various controllers on a whirlybird drone. We worked on
    adjusting the pitch, roll, and yaw of the whirlybird in order to control its
    position in space. The quickest and smoothest among the controllers we
    learned to implement was the PED controller. We modeled different systems in
    MATLAB, then implemented those same techniques in a Python script that
    communicated with the whirlybird using ROS. I learned a great deal from this
    course as we dove deeper into the mathematics of control systems as well as
    how to translate that math into code and how to interface that code with new
    systems.
