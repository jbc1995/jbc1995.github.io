    During my sophomore year at BYU, I learned basic skills in electronic
    circuit design as we had a hands-on lab where we built a stereo system. I
    learned how to properly design and pick appropriate components to get the
    desired gain in the system. I also learned quickly to troubleshoot the
    circuitry and how to avoid common mistakes.

    My knowledge and experience with this project was deepened as I later was a
    teaching assistant during my junior year for this course. It deepened my
    knowledge of electronic circuits and helped me to explain in fully to
    students that were newer to the subject than I was. I was able to teach them
    the engineering process and how to efficiently troubleshoot their designs to
    make the best systems possible.
