    During my first semester at MIT, I took a class called "Sci Fab: Science
    Fiction Inspired Envisioneering and Futurecrafting" where we developed our
    own science fiction worlds and then created an artifact derived from that
    world. This class taught me how to think more creatively and how to
    effectively manifest those creative thoughts into words, drawings, and even
    a working prototype. The artifact prototyping process itself gave me some
    good experience with time management on a project that didn't already have
    the instructions laid out for it.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    My science fiction world I created was set in the year 2060, but there are
    various groups of "neo-Amish" who have been "left behind" by technology. The
    artifact I present is an attempt at a low-cost holographic video display
    using fairly common and accessible materials. It is similar to a zoetrope (a
    device used in the 1800s as a precursor to 2D animation) in the fact that
    successive frames are illuminated one at a time to create the perception of
    motion in the image. Rather than a simple 2D drawing, however, each frame is
    a separately exposed hologram. Each exposure is of the same object (in this
    instance, an MIT class ring) rotated at different angle relative to the
    hologram plates. These plates are all fastened to a mechanical wheel that is
    rotated manually by a crankshaft handle. A viewing window is attached to
    help the viewer isolate a single frame at a time. Finally, to make the
    motion of the image as smooth as possible, each hologram is illuminated for
    a small fraction of time using a super bright white LED connected to a
    photo interrupter circuit calibrated to the perfect position of each plate.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    While the resulting image is only a looped one-second clip (much like
    today's .GIF images used frequently in text messages and social media), the
    perception of motion is there while still preserving the 3D depth
    information from the holograms. Much like how the zoetrope evolved into 2D
    animation using film strips, the principles appear to translate well to the
    realm of 3D using holography, and with holographic film already being very
    thin, the continuation of this project and its various applications are
    quite intriguing.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    This project involved use of many skills, including optics and holography
    for the actual holographic exposures, CAD modeling and physical fabrication
    of the wheel apparatus, and electronic circuit design for the strobe light
    circuit. It even borrowed some film techniques for choosing the proper
    amount of frames, and how the object should be moved for the stop-motion
    like hologram exposures. For more direct information on the build process of
    this project, see my page from the <a id="dark_link" target="_blank"
