    In my second semester at MIT, I am now taking a course called "<a id="dark_link"
    target="_blank" href="http://designinteractions.mit.edu/">Advanced
    Interactions</a>" taught by Marcelo Coelho. In our first project, titled "1D
    Interface," we were tasked to design a simple game that could only use a 1D
    array of colored pixels, then to design a controller to play the game. This
    project has taught me how to use my knowledge of programming/software and
    electronics/hardware in a new light in interaction design.

    Using Processing as the environment to program and display the game and an
    Arduino Nano along with two rotary encoders for the controller, I created a
    game called "Counting Colors." In this game, two players must memorize how
    many pixels of each color are displayed in an array of pixels. They then
    make their guesses using the controller, and are notified whether they were
    right or wrong. There are multiple rounds at different difficulty levels,
    which adds different colors to memorize and more total pixels. The player
    with the highest number of correct guesses at the end wins.

    Programming the actual game strengthened my skills in using state machines
    to define specific behavior and helped me to better learn how to get
    different sources to communicate with each other by getting Arduino to talk
    to Processing for the controls of the game. In terms of designing the
    controller, I got a great deal of practice to deepen my skills in CAD
    modeling, 3D printing prototypes, and wiring the components together, but I
    also learned good design practices to not only fit everything together in
    one package, but to make it all look and feel really good, as well.
  </p>

    Another incredibly useful thing I've learned is how to present my work to
    others in a simple manner and get useful feedback to implement and improve
    my project in various ways. These critiques have helped me refine my design
    into something that is very enjoyable for people to play at a variety of
    skill and interest levels.
