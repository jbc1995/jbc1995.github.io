    During my senior year at BYU, I was on a Capstone team with five other
    engineering students that was sponsored by Harris Corporation (now L3Harris).
    Our team was tasked with creating a fiber optic spectrum analyzer system
    that was capable of measuring multiple channels simultaneously. We broke the
    project down into multiple phases of development, and within those phases,
    we assigned ourselves various tasks to complete the project. I was tasked
    with figuring out the optics to make such a device work.

    I also was able to get a lot of valuable experience with project management.
    While my team rotated through who was the designated project leader, I was
    assigned to be the main point of contact between my team and our sponsor,
    and I was one of the lead students on writing and organizing the
    documentation for the project. The course also taught us a lot about the
    product development cycle. Overall, I had a great experience learning the
    ups and downs of product development, iterating and improving upon
    established designs, communicating with team members and supervisors, and
    technically challenging myself.
