    In my second semester at MIT, I am now taking a course called "<a id="dark_link"
    target="_blank" href="http://designinteractions.mit.edu/">Advanced
    Interactions</a>" taught by Marcelo Coelho. So far, I have learned to combine
    my knowledge of programming/software and electronics/hardware to for
    interaction design. One of the projects in the class is to design a 1D
    interface for a game that will use a single strip of LEDs for the entire game.
    Using Arduino and various buttons and joysticks to control the game, and
    Processing to create a graphical interface for the game, I have been able to
    prototype a variety of ideas for games so I can test them with other members
    of the class to critique and refine the actual interactive experience of the
    game. This class is strengthening my creativity and design skills and
    teaching how to use the skills I already have in new ways. Check back for
    the final results of this project, as well as other projects that emerge
    from the class.
