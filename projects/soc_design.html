    Between my junior and senior year at BYU, I had the chance to intern with
    the Device Development Group at Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon. There, I was a
    back-end design engineer. My role was to be the owner of a system-on-a-chip
    (SoC) partition and to run tests and change the layout of it in order to
    improve the timing and performance of the device. In so doing, I got a lot
    of experience with not only VLSI and IC layout, but also with Unix shell
    scripting.

    On top of that, I was also tasked with writing a PERL parsing script to go
    through the databases of the project and report the status of the project. I
    learned a lot about regular expressions and utilizing them to find the
    correct information efficiently and to intuitively format it for other team
    members to see. I displayed this information in both an XML spreadsheet file
    and an HTML webpage, and color coded to be more effective in relaying the
    information. The final parsing script was over 1000 lines long, and has been
    in use even after my departure from the internship.
