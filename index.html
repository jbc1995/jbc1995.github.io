  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p align="left">
    I was born and raised in Ogden, Utah. After high school and serving a
    full-time two-year mission for my church (The Church of Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints) in the Tokyo, Japan area, I started studying electrical
    engineering at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. There, I
    discovered my passion for holography and other forms of 3D display
    technology. This led me to pursue doing research at the MIT Media Lab, where
    many breakthroughs have been made in that field.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    I now live in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a full-time student/research
    assistant with my sweet wife, Kayla, and our two-year-old daughter, Lia.
    When I am not studying or doing research, I love to spend as much time with
    my family as possible. We love to watch movies, play games, and go on walks
    together. I am an avid sports fan (go Jazz!), nerd culture enthusiast (Star
    Wars and MCU expert), and video game lover (grew up with PlayStation, and am
    now also a Nintendo follower). I also love to be outdoors taking a hike,
    going camping or hunting, or just looking at the beautiful world that
    surrounds us.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    I want to discover new ways to use holography and other 3D display
    technologies to create immersive and interactive experiences for people. I
    want to push the boundaries of what those technologies currently offer to
    make something amazing. I want others to see how cool these technologies
    truly are and how they might be implemented. I want these technologies to be
    accessible so more people can try them out and create new things with them.
    Mostly, I just want to keep making the world a better place, in whatever way
    I can.
